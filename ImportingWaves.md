## Importing from wave.google.com ##

Walkaround can import waves from wave.google.com.  Go to https://wavereactor.appspot.com/import to import to the volunteer-maintained server, or point your browser at /import on your walkaround server if you are running your own.

It currently has the following limitations:
  * private replies are imported as separate waves
  * waves will appear unread
  * folder information is lost
  * Walkaround does not have support for read-only participants, so all participants will be able to modify imported waves

Playback history can optionally be imported with a server-side setting (not enabled for wavereactor).  See https://groups.google.com/group/walkaround-dev/browse_thread/thread/a94851da47813f31 for more information.
